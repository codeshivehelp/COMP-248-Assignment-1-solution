Question 1
Write a program that asks the user for several pieces of information, and displays them on the
screen afterward as a summary.
 first name
 last name
 major
 year
 student id number
 login name
 GPA (0.0 to 4.3)
Assume the first name, last name, major and login have no spaces in them, in other words are
one word long or have a hyphen in them.
Here are a few sample outputs to illustrate the expected behavior of your program. You should
follow the same formatting as shown below.
Note: user input is highlighted in grey.
Question 2
Write a program that asks a user his/her name and age and displays the following depending on
their age:
 Age is less than 16, say “You can’t drive.”
 Age is less than 18, say “You can’t vote.”
 Age is less than 25, say “You can’t rent a car.”
 Age is 25 or over, say “You can do anything that’s legal.”
Here is an example of the output to illustrate the expected behavior of your program. You may
change the formatting of the output but the program should follow the described behavior.
Note: user input is highlighted in grey.

Question 3
Isabel Briggs Myers developed a theory that there are 16 different personality types. Each type
has four letters associated with it, I or E (Introvert/Extrovert), S or N (Sensor or iNtuitive), T or F
(Thinker or Feeler) and J or P (Judger or Perceiver). (https://www.truity.com/view/types)
Develop a simple program that will determine a user’s personality based on their response to 4
questions that are to be answered by them on a scale of 1 to 10. The first question is to ask the
user if they want to do the quiz, whether the answer is yes/no, the user will still do the quiz but
a different message will be printed in each case. Next, get the user to answer the four questions
below on a scale from 1-10. Based on the answer to each question, a letter of the personality
type should be set as indicated below.
Q1: How do you get your energy?
1- Spending time alone
10- Spending time with others
Score <= 5 indicates and introvert (I) and >5 indicates extrovert (E)
